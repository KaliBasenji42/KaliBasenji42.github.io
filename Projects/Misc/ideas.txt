Si-Fi: Human civilization having to survive around a black hole near the heat death of the universe.
Horror: Story of a murder who does not relize it. Creepy hand. Twist ending.
Horror: Humans figure out immortality, but still die mentally.

Start (Cut):
It burned. Everthing. With the power of a god. Everthing, my body, mind, heart, creation. Such intense energy that everthing fused.
(Mold into poem, constrain, more creative)
