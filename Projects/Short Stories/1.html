    <h1>&#9608&#9608&#9608&#9608</h1>
    
    <p>I live a relatively normal life: I have a small apartment and a full time job at an office, I even have all my debts nearly paid off. It would be short lived. After I got up and dressed I made myself breakfast. I cannot afford a car so I take my bike to a bus stop. Once on the bus I mindlessly tap away on my phone, ignorant to the bustling and overgrown city that passed by. I arrived at a concrete tower. After entering the structure I head to the elevator. I press the button for the 6th  floor and wait. Once on the 6th floor I depart from the elevator and trek to my cubicle. I collapse into my chair and boot up my computer.</p>
    <p>I needed to work late so I sat in the office alone until 6:42. Once I finished up I headed back down to the ground floor and made sure the doors would be locked. I hopped on the bus and got off at the pub where my friends hang out.</p>
  <p>[Friend 1] greeted me, "hey, [Main Character]. Working Late?"</p>
  <p>"Yeah, I gotta finish this project by Thursday."</p>
  <p>"Have you heard of [Victim]?" [Friend 2] interjected.</p>
  <p>[Friend 1] replied "Oh yeah, that was horrible."</p>
  <p>I gave a look of confusion, "What happened?"</p>
  <p>[Friend 2] explained: "You know [Company]? Well this one lady was on her death bed. So she went to try [company]'s body emulator 
    <p>I crossed the street on my way back [to somewhere, not developed yet]. Then I heard a horrific screech to my right and I did not feel a thing, and the world snapped into darkness. I awoke what felt no more than a second later to me sitting a wooden chair at a wooden table. Across from me sat a man in a suit. He looked of average height, had brown hair, and overall seemed very average. I then realized that the walls were completely white. No, they were not white, they did not even exist, it was a boundless, foggy, void.</p>
    <p>The man then said, "[Main Character] right?"</p>
    <p>I distractedly replied, "Yeah..."<p>
