<h2>The Machine</h2>

<pre>
One machine of flesh
Reducible into smaller infinitely
Complex machines
Howling out soul
Extracting out soul
Stripping them
To a new world and
Reverting them to
An old world
</pre>

<h2>Voyager</h2>

<pre>
Rolling over an artificial surface
Hugged by mist
Hugged by darkness
A neighbor quickly passing, just as complex

No other light
For ages
"Where are you going?"
I do not know
</pre>

<h2>Too much to see</h2>

<pre>
Collision of water
Vocalization of avians and mammalians
Wind brushing flora

Wind brushing skin
Course bark
Squish of moss

Low pressure atmosphere

Filled with mist
Carrying soil
</pre>
