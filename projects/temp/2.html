  <h1>First Time Using Computers</h1>
  
  <p>
    My family still has a computer from many years ago (it has an i3 core and the disk has been having problems, but it still works). This is the same computer I learned how to use. I remember often running a 3D object editor which I used to make many objects. I would often run task manager and resource monitor, as well, as I tried to understand how a computer works. These experiences lead me to how I express my creativity.
