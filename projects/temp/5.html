  <h1>Discovery of Python then HTML</h1>
  
  <p>
    I took a coding class early in high school, and fell in love with it. I could do almost anything with a computer, and used a precise language. I have dyslexia so a coding language is much simpler to write in than a complex, exception filled language like English. I first learned Python, which is a powerful high level language (high level basically meaning closer to English, and far from assembly).
  </p>
  <p>
    I took this knowledge home and coded my own projects in my free time, learning what I needed from the internet. I later discovered HTML. HTML is the main language for website pages, and often utilizes other languages like CSS and Java Script. Learning HTML, I was learning how the websites I used for years worked (generally, modern websites are usually messy and mostly rely on JavaScript and information locked away on servers. Google is really messy, and many of their services have bad bugs). I have become very passionate about programming, and if I do not get an engineering job, coding is a close second.
