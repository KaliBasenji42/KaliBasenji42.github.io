  <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
  
  <p>
    Many events have led my life down a complex chain to who I am. I have significantly developed my leadership and communication skills. Along with a passion for nature and science. And a passion for programming. Not to mention my passion for math. And that is not to say I hate English, while I struggle with it I love expressing creativity through writing.
  </p>
  <p>
    This creativity and knowledge of HTML has led me to create my own website, which currently has a story I am writing, along with miscellaneous writings. The website also hosts projects of a STEM oriented purpose. And while my website is ongoing, it will likely stay a hobby. My main career goal is to become an engineer in the nuclear field. This career would give me the opportunity to advance energy production to be more sustainable, while bringing in a field I am passionate about (and give me plenty of money).

    [Sorry if these paragraphs are written as if I am applying for something, I have been working on a lot of scholarships recently, and it is hard to get out of the 'flow']
